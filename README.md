# Rolling the Dice üé≤

A fun 2-player dice game built with JavaScript.  
Players roll the dice and accumulate points, but if a **1** is rolled, the turn ends and no points are added.  
The first player to reach **100 points** wins!  

## About
This project was built while practicing along with **Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy**.  
It is **not my original project**, but I followed and implemented it to practice DOM manipulation, game logic, and event handling in JavaScript.  

## Rules
- Two players take turns.  
- On a player‚Äôs turn, they can roll the dice as many times as they like.  
- If they roll any number **other than 1**, it is added to their **current score**.  
- If they roll a **1**, their **current score is lost** and it‚Äôs the next player‚Äôs turn.  
- A player can choose to **‚ÄúHold‚Äù** their current score, which adds it to their **total score** and ends their turn.  
- First player to reach **100 points** wins the game.  

## Features
- 2-player gameplay
